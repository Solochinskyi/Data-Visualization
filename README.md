# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

In this Capstone Project, as a newly hired Data Analyst, I delved into the dynamic world of IT skill trends. Tasked with aiding our organization's foresight in tech evolution, I collected and analyzed data from job postings, training portals, and surveys. The focus was on discerning the most sought-after programming languages, database skills, and IDEs. Using diverse data collection methods, including web scraping and API access, I wrangled the data and applied statistical techniques for analysis. The insights were visualized using IBM Cognos Analytics, culminating in a compelling dashboard and presentation on emerging IT skills.

## Scenario 1: Data Collection
In this scenario, I collected job opening data for technologies like Java, Python, MySQL, C++, and C# using the GitHub Jobs API. This involved both API access and web scraping techniques to gather additional relevant information. After data collection, I explored the datasets to understand their structure and contents for further analysis.

## Scenario 2: Data Wrangling
Data wrangling techniques were applied to:
- Identify duplicate rows in the dataset.
- Remove duplicate rows from the dataframe.
- Determine missing values for all columns.
- Obtain value counts for the "Employment" column.
- Normalize data using two existing columns.

## Scenario 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
In this phase, I:
- Plotted distribution curves and histograms.
- Calculated the median and identified outliers in specific columns.
- Computed the interquartile range and determined upper and lower bounds.
- Explored correlations between numerical columns.
- Created a new dataframe for enhanced insights.

## Scenario 4: Data Visualization
Using the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019 dataset, I created various visualizations, including:
- Histograms
- Scatter plots
- Bubble plots
- Box plots
- Pie charts
- Bar charts
- Stacked charts

These visualizations illustrated data distribution, relationships, and counts.

## Scenario 5: Dashboard Creation
I developed three dashboard tabs using IBM Cognos Analytics:
1. **Current Technology Usage:** Displaying top languages, databases, platforms, and web frameworks.
2. **Future Technology Trends:** Highlighting desired languages, databases, and platforms.
3. **Demographics:** Presenting respondent counts by gender, country, age, and education level.

## Scenario 6: Final Presentation
For the final assignment, I created a PowerPoint presentation that narrated the analysis conducted throughout the project. This presentation was designed to be compelling, easy to understand, and supported by detailed visualizations and insights.
